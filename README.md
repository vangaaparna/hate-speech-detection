# 🛡️ Automatic Hate Speech Detection on Social Media

This project aims to automatically detect hate speech in text content posted on social media platforms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Social media is often misused to spread hate and abusive language. This project builds a text classification model that can identify whether a given comment, tweet, or post contains hate speech or not.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: A public dataset of labeled tweets/comments is used.
2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Text cleaning (removing URLs, stopwords, punctuation)
   - Tokenization and Lemmatization
3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - TF-IDF Vectorization
4. **Model Training**:
   - Naive Bayes and/or SVM trained on the vectorized data
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## 🧪 Sample Input & Output

**Input:**  
`"I hate people like you. You should be banned from this platform!"`

**Output:**  
`Prediction: Hate Speech`
