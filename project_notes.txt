PROJECT NAME: Automatic Hate Speech Detection on Social Media

OBJECTIVE:
To build a machine learning-based system that can classify social media comments/tweets into Hate or Non-Hate speech using text processing and classification algorithms.

KEY COMPONENTS:
- Data collected from Twitter (Kaggle)
- Preprocessing using techniques like stopword removal, stemming, hashtag cleaning, URL handling, etc.
- Feature engineering using:
  - Bag of Words (BOW)
  - TF-IDF
  - N-grams (bigram, trigram)
- Algorithms used:
  - Naive Bayes (Multinomial, Bernoulli)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent
  - XGBoost
  - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

SPECIAL TECHNIQUES:
- Negation Handling (`not_good` feature creation)
- Confidence score calculation using majority vote from classifiers
- Pickle used for model persistence (to avoid retraining every time)

OUTPUT:
- Detects hate speech in user input or live tweets
- Provides sentiment label (positive/negative/neutral)
- Shows accuracy comparison of different classifiers via graphs
- Confidence percentage for prediction

TESTED ON:
- Predefined dataset (Kaggle)
- Live tweets from Twitter (via API)

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Use deep learning models (BERT, RNN)
- Add multilingual support
- Build a web interface
- Train with larger datasets
